Analysis of Most Popular Start Stations in 2014/2016 using Map

Introduction: This analysis examines the most popular start stations and trip duration trends for bike sharing in New York City in 2014 and 2016. Utilizing a map visualization in Tableau, we explore how the popularity of start stations and trip durations have evolved over the two-year period. Less transit stops equals more bikes being used.  

Map Visualization: The map visualization presents start stations as bubbles, with the size and color of each bubble indicating the popularity and trip duration of the station, respectively. A measure line is available for filtering through smaller or larger bubbles, aiding in data exploration.

Key Findings:

Grand Central Station Dominance:  In both 2014 and 2016 , E 42nd St & Vanderbilt Ave near Grand Central Terminal emerges as the busiest start station with the largest and darkest bubble, indicating high trip frequency and duration.

Shift in Popular Stations: While Grand Central remains a top destination, there are notable shifts in station popularity between 2014 and 2016. In 2014, stations near New York Penn Station and Public Theatre/New York University ranked among the top three, while in 2016, stations near Central Park and colleges gained prominence.

Trip Duration Phenomenon: A significant phenomenon observed in 2016 is the station Central Park S & 6 Ave near Central Park, which despite having a smaller bubble size, exhibits the darkest color indicating longer trip durations. This suggests that despite the station serving fewer trips, the trips originating from here are notably longer, likely due to the location's proximity to Central Park.

Conclusion: The analysis highlights the dynamic nature of bike sharing trends in New York City, with shifts in station popularity and trip durations over a two-year period. While Grand Central Station maintains its dominance, other stations such as those near Central Park and colleges have gained traction. Understanding these trends is crucial for optimizing bike sharing infrastructure and services to meet the evolving demands of users in different areas of the city.

Analysis of Most Popular End Stations in 2014/2016 using Map

Introduction: This analysis investigates the most popular end stations and trip duration trends for bike sharing in New York City in 2014 and 2016. Utilizing a map visualization in Tableau, we explore how the popularity of end stations and trip durations have changed over the two-year period. No subway path has more bikes being used.

Map Visualization: The map visualization presents end stations as bubbles, with the size and color of each bubble indicating the popularity and trip duration of the station, respectively.

Key Findings:

Grand Central Station Dominance: Grand Central Terminal emerges as the busiest end station in both 2014 and 2016, characterized by a large and dark bubble on the map. This indicates high trip frequency and longer trip durations associated with this station.

Shift in Popular Stations: While Grand Central remains a top destination, there are notable shifts in station popularity between 2014 and 2016. In 2014, stations near New York Penn Station and New York Institute of Technology ranked among the top three, while in 2016, stations near Central Park gained prominence.

Trip Duration Phenomenon: A significant observation in 2016 is the station Central Park West & W 85 St near Central Park. Despite having a smaller bubble size, it exhibits the darkest color, indicating longer trip durations. This suggests that while fewer trips originate from this station, they tend to be significantly longer, likely due to the proximity to Central Park.

Conclusion: The analysis highlights the dynamic nature of bike sharing trends in New York City, with shifts in station popularity and trip durations over a two-year period. Despite Grand Central Station's continued dominance, other stations near Central Park have gained traction. Understanding these trends is crucial for optimizing bike sharing infrastructure and services to meet the evolving demands of users in different areas of the city.

Analysis of Most Popular Start Stations in 2014/2016 Using Bar Graph

Introduction:
This analysis examines the top 10 most popular start stations for bike journeys in New York City for the years 2014 and 2016. Utilizing bar graphs in Tableau, we compare the start station trends over the two-year period to identify any shifts or consistencies in station popularity.

Bar Graph Visualization:
The bar graph visualization displays the top 10 start stations for both 2014 and 2016, ranked by the number of bike journeys initiated from each station.

Key Findings:

Consistent Top Stations: Several stations maintain their popularity as top start stations across both 2014 and 2016. These include E 42nd St & Vanderbilt Ave, Lafayette St & W 8th St, and 8 Ave & W 31st St, indicating their enduring appeal among bike users over the two-year period.

Emergence of New Top Stations: While some stations remain consistently popular, there are notable shifts in station rankings between 2014 and 2016. For example, Pershing Square North emerges as a top start station in 2016, replacing E 43rd St Vanderbilt Ave from the 2014 list.

Variations in Bottom Stations: While the focus is on the top 10 stations, it's also essential to note the bottom 10 stations where fewer bike journeys originate. These stations may represent areas with lower bike usage or less accessibility to bike-sharing infrastructure.

Conclusion: The analysis highlights the evolving trends in the popularity of start stations for bike journeys in New York City between 2014 and 2016. While some stations maintain their popularity, others emerge as new favorites among bike users. Understanding these trends can inform decisions regarding bike-sharing infrastructure placement, marketing strategies, and efforts to promote sustainable transportation options in the city.

Analysis of Peak Hour Trends in March of 2014/2016 Using Line Graph

Introduction: This analysis investigates the peak hour trends for bike trips in March 2014 and March 2016 in New York City. Utilizing line graphs in Tableau, we compare the hourly distribution of bike trips to identify any differences or similarities in peak hour patterns between the two years.

Line Graph Visualization: The line graph visualization displays the hourly distribution of bike trips for March 2014 and March 2016, with each hour plotted along the x-axis and the number of trips recorded during each hour plotted along the y-axis.

Consistent Peak Hour Trends: Both in March 2014 and March 2016, the highest number of trips peak per hour occurs in the morning at 8 am and in the evening at 5 pm. This indicates a consistent pattern of commuter usage, with individuals likely using bikes for their daily commute to and from work

Similar Off-Peak Hours: The analysis also reveals that the least number of trips occur at 3 am in both 2014 and 2016. This suggests a consistent period of low usage during the early hours of the morning when most people are unlikely to be commuting or traveling.

Overall Similarity in Trends: Despite minor fluctuations, the line graphs for March 2014 and March 2016 display remarkably similar patterns throughout the day. This suggests that the peak hour trends for bike trips remained relatively consistent between the two years, indicating a stable demand for bike-sharing services during the month of March.

Limitations of Data Availability: The analysis is limited by the availability of data only for the month of March, preventing a more comprehensive analysis of peak hour trends across different seasons. However, March serves as a suitable comparison point as it marks the transition from winter to spring, capturing potential variations in usage patterns during this time of the year.

Conclusion: The analysis reveals consistent peak hour trends for bike trips in March 2014 and March 2016, with the highest number of trips occurring in the morning and evening hours. Despite minor fluctuations, the overall patterns remain similar between the two years, indicating stable demand for bike-sharing services during this period. Understanding these trends can inform decisions regarding service planning, infrastructure investment, and promotional efforts to optimize bike-sharing services in New York City.
