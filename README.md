Bar Graph Visualization:
The bar graph visualization displays the top 10 start stations for both 2014 and 2016, ranked by the number of bike journeys initiated from each station.

Analysis of Peak Hour Trends in March of 2014/2016 Using Line Graph

Introduction: This analysis investigates the peak hour trends for bike trips in March 2014 and March 2016 in New York City. Utilizing line graphs in Tableau, we compare the hourly distribution of bike trips to identify any differences or similarities in peak hour patterns between the two years.

Line Graph Visualization: The line graph visualization displays the hourly distribution of bike trips for March 2014 and March 2016, with each hour plotted along the x-axis and the number of trips recorded during each hour plotted along the y-axis.

Consistent Peak Hour Trends: Both in March 2014 and March 2016, the highest number of trips peak per hour occurs in the morning at 8 am and in the evening at 5 pm. This indicates a consistent pattern of commuter usage, with individuals likely using bikes for their daily commute to and from work

Similar Off-Peak Hours: The analysis also reveals that the least number of trips occur at 3 am in both 2014 and 2016. This suggests a consistent period of low usage during the early hours of the morning when most people are unlikely to be commuting or traveling.

Overall Similarity in Trends: Despite minor fluctuations, the line graphs for March 2014 and March 2016 display remarkably similar patterns throughout the day. This suggests that the peak hour trends for bike trips remained relatively consistent between the two years, indicating a stable demand for bike-sharing services during the month of March.

Limitations of Data Availability: The analysis is limited by the availability of data only for the month of March, preventing a more comprehensive analysis of peak hour trends across different seasons. However, March serves as a suitable comparison point as it marks the transition from winter to spring, capturing potential variations in usage patterns during this time of the year.

Conclusion: The analysis reveals consistent peak hour trends for bike trips in March 2014 and March 2016, with the highest number of trips occurring in the morning and evening hours. Despite minor fluctuations, the overall patterns remain similar between the two years, indicating stable demand for bike-sharing services during this period. Understanding these trends can inform decisions regarding service planning, infrastructure investment, and promotional efforts to optimize bike-sharing services in New York City.
